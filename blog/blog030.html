                    <p>As I'm writing this, I'm sitting at a Denny's in Rochester, MN. It's about an hour drive from my aunt's house. It's 1:38AM, and by the time I'm done here, daylight savings time will have skipped forward. It's a weird environment, right now. I'm at a booth, with a troupe of women south of me and a family speaking Spanish to the northwest of me. My order just got taken - a berry crepe with scrambled eggs. I had a nightmare a few nights ago, within which I ate some mediocre chicken and threw up. ‚ÄòTwas awful. I've been having a rough time in general with life recently ‚Äî I feel quite lonely, a lot of the time. Having pretty probably entered a hypomanic/mixed episode from my previous depressive episode, a rough time is to be expected. Hypomania is real awful; though I've had energy to do and create things, I've felt an unending emotional emptiness, and hypomania frequently precludes neutral or positive thoughts. I've felt a real shame in being me, too, which makes me feel quite hostile towards my own self-expression (especially through a medium, like creation).</p>
                    <p>I've had a craving for Denny's since coming to Minnesota. On the drive up here, it Clicked, and I finally became a changed person from IHOP. Sitting at this one, which is beside a busy multi-lane road through Rochester, near a strip mall and a bunch of hotels, feels really nice. It reminds me of the Denny's I've gone to with M@, Kip, Frog, Robbie, and more, in Houston, by Kingwood. A very, very nice place, which I loved. The one here is vastly more spacious, and built less like a diner and more like a McDonalds, but that's fine. Things are different everywhere, and right now I'm a 16 hour drive from Houston and the ur-Denny's of my mind.</p>
                    <p>Just finished eating. And the clock skipped an hour forward. It was pretty good food, and I'm glad I came here to feel all the feelings that come along with the journey here. I felt a lot of shame about halfway through the car ride, but I feel more fine now. I've had a significant amount of trouble in getting ketamine through the Mayo Clinic medical system ‚Äî  as proven by the fact I don't currently have an infusion scheduled ‚Äî so any amount of emotional development or progress is extremely cherished. I love my friends a lot, and their patience and care with me is unbelievable. Especially during a hypomanic episode, I feel deeply like I need to be handled with care, and grace, and they give me that. It at times feels like I don't deserve it, but they're there for me nonetheless.</p>
                    <p>When it's gotten quite dark recently, as it does whenever I'm struggling, I've thought a lot about the ending scene of Oslo, August 31st. Spoilers ahead. Anders relapses, and kills himself, and the camera then cuts to the locations of prominent scenes with Anders throughout the movie, with identical camera placement, but lacking him. Lacking any sign of his existence. It's such an evocative display of the emptiness that is inherent to death. There's nothing there. The cessation of all possibility, of further meaning or art. Its absence can only be known in relation to a known presence. I think about it a lot. It's really meaningful. </p>
                    <p>Anyways, this Denny's smells weird. To be more accurate, it's the Denny's in combination with my sweatshirt (which smells like cleaning chemicals) which smells weird. It smells like how ketamine tastes in my throat. Or, rather, how I remember ketamine tasting in my throat. I'm gonna drive back home, to my aunt's basement, and publish this, though the last time I used the notes app like this was to make a still-unpublished blog post. I usually write these right in VSCode, into the HTML that then gets plorted on the internet. I might work on one of my litany of unfinished projects. I might actually finish one up, if I feel like it. Who knows.</p>
