                    <p>It's May 5th; near the end of Spring! This morning, from 6:30am to 7:30am in Austin, MN, it was about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Probably the last time it'll be this cool for a good while, and I've not had the chance to wear my new coat all Spring, so I took it for about a kilometer walk around a pond! Next Fall, this coat'll no longer be new, so, y'know. It was the Last Chance.</p>

                    <p>My skin's had a sallow lustre - I was sick for a little bit a few days ago! - so it was nice to see it in the sun. I played Pokemon Go the whole walk, while a bunch of joggers wearing, like, 1 layer ran by (compared to my 3!), so it was a touch awkward. My naval bridge coat worked perfectly against the slight morning cold, though! It was really, really nice to get this last walk in, before the tides of Summer.</p>
                    <p>Been feeling pretty euthymic lately! Been getting a lot of worldbuilding done (shitton of writing and conceptualizing - a joy!), been playing a lot of Fallout: New Vegas and Hades, been just generally okay. I've been very low-energy, and in my feels, but. All's well. Heading back down to Stilly in a few days (via plane) for a Ketamine appointment, and to see my brother's commencement and celebrate my nephew's birthday. Busy 3 days comin' up!</p>
