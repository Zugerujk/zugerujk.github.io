                    Thoughts on Borne, the book
                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I read Borne, by Jeff VanderMeer, on recommendation from my good friend Crank after I loved VanderMeer's previous Southern Reach Trilogy. And, uh, I have thoughts. So this blog post is going to be entirely about Borne, the book.</p>
                    <p>And, to start, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and most of the characters within. I can only have so many thoughts about something I don't actually enjoy. A lot of this emerged in conversation with myself while I strolled circles by my kitchenette, so it might be lacking the full context required. Read Borne! It's a book!</p>
                    <p>Immediately what jumps out, and what has been toiling and tumbling in my head for days, is how rapey and missing-a-perspective the book is? It's. It's really complex. Near the end of the book, for the uninitiated, Wick reveals that he partially mindwiped Rachel - making her forget first meeting him, her first arriving to the City, and her parents brutally dying. After that, he sold those memories to the Magician, some nebulous time in the future. The circumstances of him taking her memories are, first, really... violating? In a bodily autonomy sense? Wick rescued Rachel from the holding pond because he was, reading between the lines, enamored by her and loved her. She asked Wick to erase <i>all</i> of her memories, because she knew he cared for her and, as Wick sees it, wanted to punish herself. Wick, instead, <i>only took the most recently traumatic parts</i>, which he recognizes as a fault of his. And then Wick tracks Rachel down after making her forget him, offers to have her move in with him, and then they had like. Then the book happens.</p>
                    <p>Of note, in the book, the Magician's goons attack Rachel. Wick knows this was going to happen, and doesn't tell Rachel, and his first words to her after she gets severely injured are "I'm so sorry". Then, a page later, he asks if they raped her, which they didn't, thankfully. This attack is what starts Borne's intelligence - and him and Rachel's mother/child relationship - but Rachel notably gets mad at Borne, when he first talks, for not defending her. For <i>knowing</i> what was happening, and not killing the attackers until <i>after</i> the fact. What struck me upon rereading this portion is that the entire book is written in the past tense - borrowed from Annihilation - and, thus, Rachel knows of the ultimate fault of Wick here. What Rachel is blaming Borne for ultimately is Wick's fault. But she then goes on to feel guilt towards Wick in the present tense, even though she writes about Wick's guilt without that same present-tense awareness. She writes about Wick's guilt in the attack as <i>of absence</i>, not in <i>knowing and not stopping</i>.</p>
                    <p>And, like, Wick and Rachel did a lot of sex throughout the book. A LOT. They didn't make love; they fucked. Hard. And all of this is built upon a fake ground that Wick has purposely constructed, because he "cares for Rachel". And throughout the book, Rachel never acknowledges the violence in the relationship Wick creates. She acknowledges how her breaking into Wick's apartment, and her hitting Wick, ultimately creates a violent environment for Borne to grow up in and be around. But, again, this is written in the past tense, without her present knowledge that Wick was incredibly emotionally manipulative and relationally violent.</p>
                    <p>The book ultimately fails to give Rachel a proper perspective on the violence in her relationship with Wick. It gives Wick that - through his letter - and he's very clearly a manipulative, forgiving, haunted, blameful man. He sees Rachel's relationship with Borne as something he shouldn't meddle with - as something pure and valid, unlike hers with him. But despite being written in the past tense, Rachel never acknowledges that with Wick. She gives 5 paragraphs of an explainer after the excerpt that's Wick's letter, but one that is more focused on Wick creating Mord, and of loving and cherishing Wick's ultimate decisions. From what we can see, Wick is a violent, emotionally manipulative and abusive man, and ultimately is forgiven. And <i>that's okay</i>, really. But VanderMeer doesn't ever give explanation for Rachel's forgiving him - he never really even acknowledges this. It's a huge, problematic perspective that is seemingly entirely lost on VanderMeer.</p>
                    <p>I do love Wick though. I love his character. I feel the reason Rachel never acknowledged those aspects of their relationship are because they were lost on VanderMeer, but VanderMeer did deeply understand Wick's emotions, and he did a good job writing on those. Even if they were hokey. And him making Rachel forgive, even defend Wick, is a choice.</p>
                    <p>Problematic, problematic, problematic.</p>
                    <p>Idk why VanderMeer loves turning characters into bears, but between the Southern Reach Trilogy and this, that's 4 characters. Borne and John Control would be very good friends. I think John Control is the best example of this - it's done in an extremely wonderful and fitting way to his character, and really. I think I just adore John Control. John Control resists beardom, and his final act is choosing an unknown rather than fully transform. Borne ultimately rejects beardom by becoming himself - ultimately saving the day. And Mord embraces beardom (though it's an abuse), and becomes a god. And then that other guy from the Southern Reach trilogy cuts down reeds and dies, ig.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, I think VanderMeer doesn't understand Rachel enough to give a proper perspective to her thoughts. And the ENTIRE BOOK is in her perspective 😭😭😭. If Jeff really does write a 4th Southern Reach book he's a <b>HACK FRAUD</b>.</p>
                    <p>That was mean. Sorry, Jeff. I'm gonna read Absolution when it comes out.</p>
