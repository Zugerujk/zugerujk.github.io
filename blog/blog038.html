                    <p><i>Publication note: By blogging about this, I have thus turned it (and the circumstances regarding it) into a "macroembarrassment". But it's all in good fun.</i></p>
                    <p>Throughout my daily life I do a lot of things. Some of these things are incredibly minorly embarrassing. Not in a way that actually means anything for my character, but which impacts my physiomental subpsychoconscious in a noticeable way. I just did one, so cataclysmic, I feel the need to blog about it.</p>
                    <p>I'm in Ben Saint's Discord server. I joined one night while in an RFCK VC, to tell some bad joke, but fell asleep before actually telling said joke, and didn't remember the joke by the time I woke up. Yesterday, at 2:14 AM, I sent this tweet to Ben Saint, upon seeing it.</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">Precursor pt. 1. Afterwards, I sent a clarifier that this was not meant in a rude way, merely that seeing Mega Man made me think of Ben (though some of my friends would say that meaning it in a rude way would've been based)</p></center>
                    <p>After this, I looked at Ben's Discord server, and saw a discussion that ended with someone mentioning Gundam. I then said SEED was cool, and gave an account about my 10th grade English class experience with Meyers-Briggs (as the previous conversation had been about Meyers-Briggs). After this, an individual named "CoolerMann (Mourning Koldi)" struck up a conversation with me. 'Twas a good conversation, fr!</p>
                    <p>Since that conversation, this past day I've been looking at Ben's Discord server. Today, someone posted this:</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">Precursor, pt. 2. Talking about Chile, the country. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±</p></center>
                    <p>In response to this, I replied with this image <reinin>(7 hours after the fact)</reinin>:</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">What my brain instantly thought of. ðŸ¤¦</p></center>
                    <p>I then, paraphrased, said "this was so funny my eye began twitching", then said "fuck", then said "it wasn't even funny", then said "it doesn't even make sense". I then deleted all 5 messages, my tail between my legs, no idea who had seen what, leaving a phantom ping behind at the scene of the crime. This entire time, I was also ranting this out loud to Taco in VC (who I'd just played 2 games of Bloodbowl II with. I killed his Amazonian named Tokina Sora!!!).</p>
                    <p>Truly, one of my darkest moments. The cowardice, to self-justify, then delete. Boy, I sure hope somebody got fired for that blunder. The inhumanity.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, life going okay right now! I've got a psychiatrist appointment in an hour to talk about ketamine and long-term care plans, and I visited Tulsa for Gundam Club on Sunday and got to see all the guys. Here's me next to the human-sized RX-78-2 they got in! Shoutouts Hunter for taking the photos!</p>
