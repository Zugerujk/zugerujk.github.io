It felt hours long - like their consciousness was trapped between existences. They described themselves as a 'level 2 spell slot'. It went really bad, though it did give them a surprising boost in memory." />

                    <h2>Personal Loss: Take5 Bar</h2>
                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I loved the Take5 Bar, from Hershey's. It was always an obscure chocolate bar, though one I connected highly with. It launched in 2004 - the year I was born. Throughout my childhood I'd have them occasionally, and I'd love them. I'd love them dearly.</p>
                    <p>I recently moved to Minnesota, just, uh. Idk. I wanted to, so I did, and now I live in my aunt's basement, for the foreseeable future. I also turned 20, on January 20th, 2024. Most things nowadays feel weird, and bad. To quote The Microphones, "There's no end, there's no glory. There's a slow resounding story. There's no place to feel certain. There's nobody waiting for me. There's no stand of trees, no morning. There's a curve without a warning. There's a weird and lasting sadness, there's no large and lengthy warming."</p>
                    <p>Been trying to reconnect with myself to cheer myself up recently, and one of those things involved buying (and eating) a Reese's Take5 Bar. These things weren't Reese's before Covid, but, uh, it's a rebrand that happened right at the end of 2019 (which is technically before covid, but, I mean. I wasn't paying attention). And they taste bad now. They taste like a Reese's peanut butter cup, which I don't like. They don't taste as salty as I remember, as sharp as I remember, as. As unique, as memorable, as noteworthy. But, I mean. I don't know whether they changed, or I changed. Apparently it's always been Reese's peanut butter? But I don't remember that. But then again, I couldn't identify with much of any of the modern Take5 flavor profile.</p>
                    <p>It's a loss. Something I can't get back. A small microcosm of a larger concept - of time. Now that I'm 20, and in Minnesota, I'm far away from my past. And. It's hard. It's really hard. And I'm really scared. I look back on photos of myself - from 2021, when I was at my darkest but also the happiest year of my life. From 2022, when I was going through immense personal change, and somehow made it out. From 2023, when I felt stagnant, and difficult, and failing. And I. I'm not those things anymore. I don't know what I am, in 2024. Entering my 20s.</p>
                    <p>I've been thinking of starting a big personal project, with some friends. IDK if it'll ever really materialize. But I feel the need to work on something other than my endless thoughts. I feel like a Reese's Take5 Bar, really.</p>
                    <p>Shoutouts to all of my close friends, for being there for me all the time, and especially these past few weeks.</p>
