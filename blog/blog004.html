                    <p>I've been thinking a lot about love recently, and what it feels like. And how I feel it. This blog post'll cover a lot of different things, but I'll begin it with a tweet.</p>

                    <p>If you're reading this blog post, there's a high chance I feel a bond with you. I do with almost all of my friends, and even some who would consider me just an acquaintance (which is fine). I just, damn, I can't really describe it with words. I feel this deep emotion in my core with so many people I know, when I think of them, or hang out with them, or when we share an experience. I call that "love", cuz, I mean, I just think that's what "love" is. In the past I didn't feel it much, but upon joining RFCK in March 2021, it really became the sole emotion in my life I lived for. The people I met there, and through there, taught me so many things about friendship and the emotional bonds I share with others. The strands, one might say. But really, I didn't know I could feel that way about others, and that others could share that with me. I've definitely cooled down a little over the years, but I just think of all the exuberant love and joy I've shared with others over that time, and god. It's such a temporal thing — how I can feel something so strongly in the past, and continue that into the present, knowing I felt that back then.</p>
                    <p>In November 2022, I felt the unnatural urge to play Death Stranding. I just <i>had</i> to, y'know? So, out of nowhere, I bought the game (a few hours before it went on sale 😵‍💫) and played it. November 2022 was one of my deepest depressive episodes, but fuck, Death Stranding carried me through the latter half of that. It was just a special game, that really hit and connected with me. And I bring it up, because the <i>ethos</i> of the game — of building connections with others — really stuck with me. I rarely call it "life stranding", but just, damn. The idea that the connections I build with others are important, and are the reason to live life, and that there's some ethereal force of emotion that bonds us. It's just. It really affected me. I can't mention love without mentioning the game.</p>
                    <p>I flew down to Houston just last week, from July 25th to the 28th, to see M@, Kip, Frog, Rob, and M@'s DnD crew, as well as to celebrate M@'s birthday. It went really well, and was really personally fulfilling. It made me feel the joy of life, the reason to continue going. We shared such mirth! And Phoebus, I just, it made me feel love so much. I can't fully describe the overflowing love that I feel for M@, Kip, Frog, Rob, and everyone I saw there. I could cry at how much I love them. I really do feel that way with a lot of friends. They add so much to my life, my soul, that I cry when I think about the full connection I've shared with them. I watched Frances Ha with Kip the night of the 25th, and the core of that movie — of loving someone — really hit, really hard. Right now I'm reminded of Past Lives, and Arthur saying "you make my world so much bigger". Past Lives is so kino. But also, that love I feel for people, and that people feel for me, is just something that happens. And that's really beautiful, isn't it? It's just some connection that forms between me and others, of ALL people interlinking, that creates the world.</p>
                    <p>When things get dark in life, love is the one thing that keeps me going. I'm a bipolar 2 warrior so, uh, things get dark frequently enough. But just, jeez, it's the point of life, y'know? It's the point of life. To love others, and to be loved by others. And, damn, the future doesn't look too bright for the world, and that's really hard to think about sometimes. I'm reminded of two things when I think about that fact, though. First, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mueUwrjOP60>of this song by Julia Jacklin.</a> Second, <a href=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48423/the-mower-56d229a740294>of The Mower, by Philip Larkin.</a> More specifically, the lines "...we should be careful ¶ Of each other, we should be kind ¶ While there is still time."</p>
                    <p>Apologies that this blog post is less structured than the rest. Just, like, there's a lot of things I've needed to get off my mind. I recently began dating someone (first date earlier today 😱), and I've been reflecting on the emotions I feel for him, and the love I feel for others. For him, it's very much affection, y'know? Like, I wouldn't die for him. I don't feel that love for him yet, 'cuz we haven't build that bond. So, culturally, it feels weird to give our relationship the special name of "dating", 'cuz there are many people with whom I share a much, much deeper, much more complex relationship. I don't really think, within me, there's a difference between "romantic love" and "platonic love", so. It's weird to think about. It's just. Rgh. I'm also moving out into an apartment, so I've been thinking of the passage of time, and of change. It's scary.</p>
                    <p>But, y'know. When I think of love, I think of my many friends, both past and present. I think of the care we've shared for eachother. And I think that's the greatest thing.</p>
