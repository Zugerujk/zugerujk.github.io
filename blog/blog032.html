                    <p>If I publish this around 11pm CST, on the 1st of April, then it'll be 673 hours until NieR Re[in]carnation shuts down, at 00:00 CST April 30th. If I did my math and conversions right.</p>
                    <p>I downloaded it 2 days ago, and am playing on Bluestacks. I'm near the end of the Main Quest 6th Chapter, though not fully yet. I've found the game a little fascinating - it has completely passive gameplay, which is extremely boring and unengaging to play. It has a Genshin Impact-esque Gacha, which is mostly unrewarding. But the game itself? It's calmly beautiful, with gorgeous music, characters, and worlds. And the story so far is sparse but effective, at least in my opinion. It plays, and reads, like weapon stories from NieR, which I enjoy.</p>
                    <p>And, of course, it's all ending in 29 days. The entire thing is coated with "Goodbye" and an End of Service notice, and you get an absurd amount of free gacha pulls by logging in, along with 20,000,000 free in-game dollars along with enough items to max out the XP and abilities of multiple characters and weapons. It's over, it's ending. And, idk. I feel like that's really fitting for NieR. It's a game all about the end of cycles, of of fighting for those you love even when you're doomed. To quote Kainé and Emil, "Our journey may have been meaningless. <i>Our past may have been a mistake.</i> But we're not going back. <i>Even if this world comes to an end.</i> Because this... This is the world with the people we cherish."</p>

                    <p>Oh, and I'm back in Stillwater now, for healthcare. I've got ketamine tomorrow, at 3pm. 🫡</p>
