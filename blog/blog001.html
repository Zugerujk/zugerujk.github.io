                    <p>I was just playing Minecraft with my nephew, who's a little over 5 years old now. I had a good time, although idk if he did; he's a little self-defeatist, which is depressing for a 5 year old to be. He thanked me for playing with him, 'cuz he's a good kid. He's such a good kid, I wish the absolute best for him. But you know what really weirds me out?</p>
                    <p>He says "bruh". "C'mon bruh", to be specific. He's developmentally behind (can't read, can't spell), but yet speaks wholly unlike a 5 year old should. I feel soooooo old when he says "bruh". It's creepy. It's terrifying. He sounds like a South Park baby, saying "c'mon bruh". I just watched Season 18 (the one with Pewdiepie), so that's instantly what my mind jumps to. He watches a bunch of Minecraft YouTubers unsupervised, which definitely isn't good, but damn. He didn't even know what a "word" WAS, but he's saying "bruh". Serious bruh moment.</p>
                    <p>I saw Past Lives on July 4th, at the AMC Theatres at Quail Springs Mall. 'Twas about an hour drive from where I live. It was a really phenomenal movie - extremely good, and accomplishes everything it wants to do perfectly. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/zugerujk/film/past-lives/">I have a review for it on my Letterboxd.</a> Anyways, it takes place in 2024, and I wonder. Will my nephew be able to read in 2024? What new, hip lingo will he be saying in 2024? It's terrifying to think about.</p>
                    <p>I also wanted to bring up Past Lives just because it's been on my mind. What kino. Here's a photo I got a kid to take of me in the hallway outside of the movie. I see every movie in theatres with my plush Koromaru. Ignore what my face is doing.</p>
