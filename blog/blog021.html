                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I've been lighting a lot of candles recently. Candles are really beautiful, and my mom buys a bunch of really nice-smelling ones. I make sure to light them carefully, and I keep them under supervision. I love how, when you light a candle after it's already been previously lit, the flames ignite and sputter on the used wicks. They spit out smoke, before calming down to do their usual dance. I like holding my hand above them â€” far enough to not be painful, but close enough to feel the tingle of heat. It reminds me of being in Boy Scouts, and of crowding around a fire in a pit in below-freezing weather. I like the smell of smoke when I blow them out, and how it lingers in my apartment.</p>
                    <p>I watched Fargo Season 5, Episode 4 earlier today, with Kip. Seedless to Nay (the Cookie Clicker achievement, which I have), the idea of fire is on the mind. Not in a negative way, just a... thematic way? This is an old building, and the wiring's extremely wack, and it's all so, so delicate. So here's some cherished things, around my house, for insurance purposes.</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">Glazed Snail. $28. Found at the resale store 1 block away. My mom thought it was a waste of money, but I disagree.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021lamp.png" width="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Well-Used Floor Lamp. $0. Borrowed from my brother. It has to hang against a wall, as it's wont to fall over.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021painting.png" height="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Eiffel Tower Painting. $19. Found at Goodwill. Almost everyone who's entered my apartment has signed this, if I remember to ask them.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021couch.png" height="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Couch, Snow Rilakkuma. $0, $49. The couch is borrowed from my sister, while the Rilakkuma was gifted for Christmas 2020. The Rilakkuma migrates between the couch and a kitchen chair, and formerly lived on top of the Minecraft Bee Plush on my bed.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021fridge.png" width="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Things on the Fridge My Landlord Owns. $233. The MG Destiny + stand was too tall for any of my shelves, and the top of the fridge was unclaimed territory. Thus, it became the Destiny Fridge. The Mega Size Unicorn is a tribute to my High School tech theatre teacher Mr. Reding, who had a Mega Size Unicorn on the highest shelf in his office overseeing it. Doing the same with my Mega Size Unicorn felt fitting.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021ricecooker.png" height="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Rice Cooker. $19. Appliance I cherish far more than I actually use.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021phenex.png" width="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">MG Phenex. $125. Bought this kit secondhand, from Mr. Reding. It was at a steep discount alongside some other very nice kits, so the true price is as an amalgam. We did the deal in the parking lot behind the high school, by Walls (the store), in cash. It's the worst gunpla build I've ever done, but I cherish it fully.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021boxfan.png" width="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Box Fan. $24. AC doesn't work in Winter, so if the apartment is too warm, I open the front door and turn this fan on.</p></center>        
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021shower.png" height="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Shower Curtain and Rod. $19. Had to buy my own curtain rod, and will be taking it with me.</p></center>
                    <center><img src="blog-media/021/021desk.png" height="400px" width="auto"></center>
                    <center><p class="caption">Righthand Area of my Desk. $?. Messy, but everything here is placed with love. I look at them frequently while doing other things.</p></center>
