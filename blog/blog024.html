                    <p>I went to Panera Bread on Monday! It was a cold winter day, and the roads were almost entirely frozen, so the 2-minute drive there was very perilous and I was very careful. I wrote a review of the food, as my dear friend Matthew H. D. May requested that I do so after an epic Alan Woke session. And, y'know, it's lowkey blog material. So, at 1/15/2024, 10:58 AM CST, I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"Main course: Classic Panera bagged Mac and Cheese. Creamy, smooth, and delectable on a cold winter day like today. They were heavy on the cheese today - there was a lot of it! Goes along scrumptiously with the Baguette, though the Baguette is good all its own. It arrived at the perfect temperature - hot enough to need to be cooled a little. The baguettes are different than they used to be, but the new baguettes are perfectly fine on their own. The flavor profile today was very savory, with a light hint of bitterness from the bread. All of this paired with an unsweet iced tea? Yummy lunch, hear hear.</p>
                    <p>Extras: Cranberry Muffin. Sweet! Some sourness! Pairs oddly well with the aftertaste of the main course. It's very sugary, and the dough of the muffin leaves a fluffy, pastry aftertaste. Doesn't pair as well with unsweet iced tea as the main course, though it's still quite good. There's also a chocolate chip cookie that I paid for, though I'll be saving that for later in the day. I like chocolate chip cookies quite a lot."</p>
