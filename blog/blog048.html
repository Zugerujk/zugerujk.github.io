                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>Well, y'all, we're at the midpoint of 2024 already. Time moves fast and life moves fast, and I really do feel like doing a wrap-up once every 6 months would make a lot more sense with how my mind remembers things. What a time it's been! Shortly after my 20th birthday, January 20th, I moved from Oklahoma to Minnesota, and, uh. I've been living my best life up here, getting centered in mind and self-actualizing best I can. It's been real hard, as life can be, but I feel. Uh. Happy. Not exactly stable, but happier than I've been in years, I guess. Euthymia comes and goes, but it's been a lot more common recently. I feel a lot healthier now, in body and in mind.</p>
                    <p>As for the art I've witnessed, experienced, let into me wholly through my soul and core? Major-key favorites include:</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... ‚Äî Kinologic. This was in the Honourable Mentions of last year's end wrap-up, as I started playing it at the end of 2023, and, uh. Boy howdy lmao. Game of all time. Changed my mind and life. <a href="https://zugerujk.net/blog/blog022474487139%E2%80%A6">Check out the blog post I wrote about it!</a></p></center>

                    <center><p class="caption">Morrowind ‚Äî This was also on the Honourable Mentions of last year, and I fell further in love with it this year. Zug the Argonian's adventure was great, but tromping around as Amongus Nathan the Nord truly cemented it in my mind as unparalleled in many aspects.</p></center>

                    <center><p class="caption">I Saw The TV Glow ‚Äî Iconic trans cinema. One of the most viscerally horrifying films I've yet seen. Idk how well it'll hold up upon rewatch, but how I felt when I first saw it was real. Phenomenal art ‚Äî phart.</p></center>

                    <center><p class="caption">Plastic Death by Glass Beach ‚Äî Gooooood music! I'm not even the biggest fan of half of the songs, but the other half are some of the best songs I've ever heard. The songs coelacanth, guitar song, rare animal, and abyss angel are transcendental. ‚ÄúFly from still water‚Äù hits unbelievably hard, personally, because I flew from Stillwater (my hometown). Coincidental, but. Shit, man! It's personal!</p></center>
                    <center><p>Honourable Mentions:</p></center>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Smiling Friends Season 2 ‚Äî I love Charlie and Pim! Yippee!!!</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Baldur's Gate 3 ‚Äî Really, really, really, really, really, really good. Good good. My first playthrough was as The Dark Urge, and my second playthrough was with my friend Hayden, where SHE played as The Dark Urge. Seedless to nay, both playthroughs broke pretty fundamentally at certain points, and I still haven't experienced the game in a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way. Shoutouts to my brother Alex for buying it for me!</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ NieR Re<reinin>in</reinin>carnation ‚Äî Blogged about this whopper a whole bunch. 10H my belov'd. RIP, you were so mediocre but deserved so much better üíî</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ NieR Automata ‚Äî Didn't like it as much as the other 2 NieRs, but. Good stuff!</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ The Castle ‚Äî Great, difficult, annoying read.</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Being John Malkovich ‚Äî Iconic trans cinema.</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ All of Destroyer's discography ‚Äî Got into Destroyer the second time I drove up to Minnesota solo. I was agog at Kaputt, and some of the rest are about as good!</p> 
                    <p>‚Ä¢ Splatoon 3 ‚Äî It's so fucked I like this game. It's <i>soooo</i> fucked.</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ <a href="https://x.com/desivirgil/status/1777703184762355723">T'es Woke Toi</a> ‚Äî The load-bearing tweet that it is.</p>
                    <p>Currently back in Stillwater, spending the night at my friend's place because another friend is back in town. About to crack a friend's DS. So, uh. Fun night ahead. And fun year ahead, hey! 2024's been looking up, ish! Let's go reddit!</p>
