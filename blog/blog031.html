They actually have an indie soda store in Bloomington, MN, so I wonder if they have any Pear Cola. Just googled it, actually, and Pepsi at one point made Bamboo Pear cola, but ONLY in China. FUCK.

                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>It's good. Tastes raspberry-y. The main flavor profile lacks the material depth that regular Coca-Cola has, and it's replaced with a cheap berry flavoring. Its impact is still heavy, with a harsh initial attack, and its wideness and bigness in the mouth is the same, there's just much less "Coca-Cola" meat. It's better than other limited-edition Coca-Cola flavors, but it draws comparison to Pepsi Mango, which is, I mean. Pepsi Mango knocks this shit out of the park. The most interesting part about Coca-Cola Spiced is the aftertaste, which is sickeningly sour, like a warhead.</p>
                    <p>Man, I've not had Pepsi Mango recently. They stopped stocking it at the gas stations near me in Oklahoma, and now that I'm in Minnesota, it's literally nowhere. Thankfully, up here they've got Baja Blast in 12-packs. Though, weirdly, the canned Baja Blasts don't taste the same as their Taco Bell fountain drink counterpart. Taste a bit worse, and more, uh, "mountain dew"-y.</p>
                    <p>No blog updates recently cuz my life hasn't been going too great. I've been trying to get ketamine set up at the Mayo Clinic, but my 2 visits to them were kinda dehumanizing and I was fundamentally disrespected the entire process. I'm continuing to sink into a pit, so I'm gonna be traveling back to Oklahoma for ketamine. My left eyelid also began twitching, and that's getting progressively worse, so I'm gonna get that checked out. Spooks me. Scares me.</p>
                    <p>'Till next time.</p>
