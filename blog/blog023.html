                    <p>I got a new coat over the holidays. It's a naval bridge coat, which I became obsessed with after finding out it existed on the 15th of December. My dad ordered a dead guy's $70 coat off of eBay, and now I have it. It's nice. It's, like, 7 pounds; it broke 3 plastic hangers (1, then 2 together) at the dry cleaner's before they put it on a wooden one. According to the inner tag, it belonged to R. E. Lundquist/Lurnquist, who was an ensign in the Navy. So, uh, thank you for the coat, dead man.</p>
                    <p>I wore it to Bingo Night this Monday (Jan. 8th) with a friend, and he took some banger photos of me with it while we were in downtown. I was also wearing my extremely "a choice" patterned pants that I got for christmas, which I adore. Here those are!</p>
