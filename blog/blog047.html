                    <p>Well, guys. I finally finished The Castle. Boy howdy. Took me a while. It's a difficult read! It took me a real long while to just, I mean, get through it. <a href="https://zugerujk.net/blog/blog045">Details in blog045.</a> But, like. By <reinin>Phoebus</reinin>, it's <i>such</i> an anti-compelliing (and thus compelling) book! The prose, the structure, the everything. Barnabas and Frieda were unbelievably well-rounded characters, and I was truly fascinated by K.'s relationship with the both of them. K. is a disgusting, soul-sucking, somehow ununsympathetic protagonist, and was, just, truly fascinating to follow. I kinda hated what he was doing ‚Äî how much of an inherent failure he was ‚Äî but. It was liberating, to follow him, to feel with him, to hear him go on soliloquys and be soliloquy'd <i>at</i>. I wanna reread it soooooo badly, but it took me so long and was such a slog, I'm gonna. I'm gonna wait a few years, probably, but now Amerika and The Trial are on my reading list. Next up: The Memory Police, by Yoko Ogawa! The cover has one of those unbelievably-ugly printed-on stickers, but, y'know, what can you do.</p>

                    <p>I did maintenance ketamine last week, and lemme say, I am building a tolerance. I can hold mein gott damn ketamine! Anyways, uh, during it, I took some selfies I have literally no memory of taking, while in the pitch-black darkness. Usually I do that hand thing I do towards the camera in the room, but in the two photos that have the most clarity when enhanced I'm‚Ä¶ not doing that. Observe me while stranding out, as I wished to be seen:</p>

                    <p>My flight back to Minnesota was quite bad, but when is it not. My flight outta Tulsa was delayed by 3.5 hours, and by the time it actually happened there were just 6 of us that hadn't been transferred to different flights. We all sat in first class, and got sodas and pretzels before taking off, while just chatting with the crew and amongst ourselves. It was a real jovial environment ‚Äî real nice and all. It was my first time ever flying first class, and honestly? I don't get the hype. Maybe worth 20 extra dollars. But it was nice.</p>

                    <p>My layover in DFW was about 8 hours and it was uncomfortable as ever. I really felt like I did not belong. Auntie Anne's doesn't even serve pretzels in the morning, apparently, so I got a bagel from Starbucks. I remember wishing I had someone close by to hold me. It's so fucking lonely and barren in airports, especially in that gigantic Terminal D.</p>
                    <p>I've been working on my game. Developing and making assets for the vertical slice alpha. It's progressing slowly but surely. Pretty muddled, but what of which I create isn't?</p>
                    <p>I've been in a dour mood since last night, honestly. I've been going to a board game club in town up here every Friday, called Meeple Center, and. They just never get my pronouns right. I've been going for months and I bring it up every time, and no matter if I make a big deal out of it or not, it's for naught. They don't do it, <i>refuse</i> to do it. It's a constant reminder they don't respect me, don't have the space nor the care. It makes me feel like shit every time. Idk why I even try. I think I'll go quietly, and just stop coming. I've tried so much and there's no reason to keep doing so. Shoutouts Paul, the 35yo guy who looks my age who gets it right every time and corrects other people for me. Ally ‚úäüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà</p>
                    <p>I've not watched many good movies in the past week and a half. I really feel I need to watch more artful cinema, and not schlock, but schlock is just toooooo captivating. Though, y'know, I did watch From Beyond, which was some fantastic 80s sleaze. Would fucking adore to watch that with friends sometime. Nowhere near as good as Re-Animator, but, y'know, not everything can be Re-Animator. I'm planning to watch Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence's 4k remaster at Pop's Art Theatre sometime in the next week; kinography walks.</p>
