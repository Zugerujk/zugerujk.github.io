                    <p>AND my credit card information. Which is, like, fucking insane! I was trying to sign up for DigitalOcean earlier, just to <i>see their pricing</i>, and lemme tell you. It was a ROUGH time. They had 5 Roblox-esque captchas at the start when you "sign in with Google", but that quickly extended to 15. Then, once I was in, it asked to link a payment method to "verify my identity".</p>
                    <p>I chose the PayPal option first, but that required a $5 payment minimum to "verify my identity". So I clicked back, and it made me <i>redo the captcha.</i> Bizarre! But then, as I do with most of the Roblox-esque captchas, I failed 1 of the 15 I was served. Thus, I had to do all 15 again. I then entered my credit card information, which I did not have to pay for.</p>
                    <p>HORRIBLE user experience. Galoshes, I hate captchas. They're the worst! I swear, robots definitely are better at those things than I am.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, JavaScript stuff coming soon (maybe) (possibly). I've got a big project in the works. If you wanna know the deets, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kizpf1E0wAM">watch my Soda Review all the way through.</a> It's a good review — I think I did a good job 😌.</p>
