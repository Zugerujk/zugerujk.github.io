                    <h2>NieR Re<reinin>in</reinin>carnation - 202 hours remain</h2>
                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I've been doing a lot of NieR Re<reinin>in</reinin>carnation's side content, now! And holy shit. I love 10H, guys. 10H is one of the best NieR characters, I love her so much, she's peak, she's amazing. She's perfectly written, and does her part in the story in such a phenomenal way. I'm glad her creation that she imbued all of her memories into came back to see Hina and Yuzuki at the end of the game. Her hidden story is so wonderfully, eloquently written, I'm glad Re<reinin>in</reinin>carnation got to live long enough to bring her to life.</p>
                    <p>With the small time remaining with the game, I've been building up a B team (the B stands for Besties)! It's made up of EX Hina, Abstract 10H, and Abstract Yuzuki, and it's been fun to teambuild with the immense resources I have at the end of the game.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, uh, I'm back in Minnesota! I've watched some movies recently, and the clear standouts in my mind have been Being John Malkovich and The Thing. They're both absolutely fucking phenomenal movies which totally deserve their reputation. I was kinda taken aback by how <i>good</i> the lighting in The Thing is. The death of film lighting is quite a sad thing, indeed! Anyways, cannot highly recommend them enough.</p>
                    <p>I recently came out in RFCK about the extremely manipulative "friendship" I had with Krak, and everyone was really supportive and nice about it. Ben sent a few nice messages, and, idk. I feel a whole shitton better now that it's public that Krak hurt me really badly, and is a bad guy.</p>
                    <p>I've been listening a bunch to band named Destroyer recently. One of my favorite artists, Cassandra Jenkins, released a new single, and in the r/indieheads post about that single, someone mentioned Destroyer. I listened to their album Kaputt, and holy SHIT. It's SO GOOD! It's insane! It's been my <a href="https://zugerujk.net/blog/blog017">insulindian phasmid</a> for the past 96 hours. It's peak. It's insanely good. Anyways, I'm currently writing this while spectating a Bloodbowl II game between Taco and M@. It's between their star teams - Taco's Amazonians and M@'s Dwarves - and. Idk. It's really nice to be around them. Life's looking up! <reinin>Life's looking up!</reinin></p>
