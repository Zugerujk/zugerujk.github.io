                    <p>I'm apartment living now, y'all. I live in an APARTMENT. Near my COLLEGE CAMPUS. On the SECOND FLOOR. It's crazy. Moving in has been such an experience - it's honestly been really difficult, and really eye-opening at how hard, like, everything is. But it's cool. I'm cool. It's really cool.</p>
                    <p>But you know what's not really cool? Not having utilities. And speaking of not having utilities, I still don't have internet. I moved in 6 days ago - almost a week! - and yet I still cannot use any in-unit internet to browse the interwebs. Or, say, access Zugerujk.net to see awesome epic blog posts.</p>
                    <p>About 2 days ago, an Optimum technician entered my apartment to set up my internet service. He was really cool, and honestly was an amazing guy. We chatted gundam and board games while he set up my internet, and I got him to sign my apartment's ledger (which is an extremely ugly painting I found at goodwill). 10/10 guy. However, the service he provided? Not so much! The router is still not connected to the internet, 2 days later. So I still don't have internet, 6 days after moving in.</p>
                    <p>That's the story. It's pretty crazy, I know. But I don't hold any ill will towards the technician who came - he was really cool, I liked him. As a sidenote, I just brought my first laundry basket over to the laundry room, which is about a 45 second walk away, down a stairwell. Wow, what an experience! It's pretty crazy to think any time I do laundry I will have to make that trip 3 times there and 3 times back. That's, like, 4.5 minutes of walking just to do the laundry.</p>
                    <p>I also have a gas stove right now. Which is pretty funny, but also pretty spooky. Who knows what'll come of that. Find out later on my blog! 👻😱🔥</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Addendum: After rereading this, I realized I completely forgot to mention the robot phone call. Anyways, I called Optimum to ask why my internet wasn't working and a robot answered. They then asked me what I needed help with? And then there was, like, 10 seconds of dead air, because I was expecting a menu. They then prompted me to say what I needed help with, and I hung up. It was fucking terrifying! I hate the future. I don't want to talk to a robot, I either want to navigate a menu or talk to a living human person with lungs and vocal chords. Anyways, uh, sorry for forgetting the title until the very end. Until next time, Zugerujk.net blog squad 🫡.</p>
