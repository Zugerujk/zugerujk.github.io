                    <p>I'm, like, so depressed. I withdrew from OSU depressed. Haven't done the dishes in over a week depressed. Doing another series of ketamine infusions depressed. But, y'know, I'm feeling kinda okay today. First time in a while; took me long enough! With this newfound energy, I'm gonna BLOG about KETAMINE.</p>
                    <p>I did infusion #4 out of 6 yesterday. 35mg. Boy howdy, it was genuinely just okay. I listened to A Crow Looked At Me during it, which is just, like, the best album for when you're half-sedated half-high. I also peeped the new The Smile song Wall of Eyes, which sounds pretty awful when you're on ketamine.</p>
                    <p>Infusion #3 was quite enjoyable. I was doing a live recap of it in a Discord channel I share with some close friends, and M@ chimed in during it, and that felt really nice. I do those live recaps frequently, and I actually come to regret a few of them quite a lot. My blog posts are kinda the only personal writings I do that I don't feel the extreme need to recant.</p>

                    <p>Infusion #2 was the BAD one. It was AWFUL. It was like my entire mind collapsed in on itself multiple times, and then my subjective consciousness was ripped away from my mind. Kinda, like, my mind rejected a "K-hole" (which I've still never experienced), and my subjective consciousness was dragged kicking and screaming down anyways. Can't recall much after that. It was frankly horrifying and very violating. Uh. Sucked.</p>
                    <p>Infusion #1 was really milquetoast. Idk. It was boring, and nice (maybe?), and I don't remember much. I remember DMing Kip in the middle of it, which I of course regretted immediately after because it was frankly incomprehensible. It feels bad to be so vulnerable to people in that way, y'know? It's hard. And tough. I don't feel great about literally babbling to a friend about how much I appreciate them while high. Vulnerability comes somewhat naturally to me, but it still feels juvenile and uncomfortable to do stuff like that <i>while high.</i></o>.</p>

                    <p>I recently read John Green's The Anthropocene Reviewed, as recommended by my friend M@. Extremely phenomenal book that I cried to multiple times. Academic Decathlon, cave paintings at Lascaux, and sunsets are my 3 favorite reviews, though I would've liked the ending review on Young Farmers more had I not already thoroughly consumed John Green's The Art Assignment video on the same photograph. I've seen that video multiple times throughout the past few years; it's a masterpiece. Anyways, speaking on vulnerability, he says, "there's something deep within me, something intensely fragile, that is terrified of turning itself to the world. I'm scared to even write this down, because I worry that having confessed this fragility, you now know where to punch. I know that if I'm hit where I am earnest, I will never recover. ...But I want to be earnest, even if it's embarrassing."</p>
                    <p>Earlier this month, immediately before getting so depressed I became unable to function, I did front of house and security for a drag show on campus. Afterwards, me and the OSQ&Asties had a night on the town, and by 2AM I got Matt (different person) to drive to my favorite power plant so I could show them and Beck (the only other exec still awake). I don't remember who, but one of them joked that we could just drive to the border to Kansas and go to the midwest. It would be a long, pointless drive, and we had just ran a drag show and were DEAD tired.</p>
                    <p>Here a photo from Arkansas City, on the border. I'm somewhat embarrassed by this pointless trip but, y'know. It was fun.</p>
