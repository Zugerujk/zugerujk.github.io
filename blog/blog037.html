                    <h2>The <reinin>eclipse</reinin></h2>
                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I saw the North American Solar Eclipse today, April 8th, 2024. My eldest brother, sister, and nephew accompanied me on the roadtrip (and did most of the driving). We went to Batesville, Arkansas. It was special. It was astounding to realize, in my earthly body, that it can happen here. That my own life is a space where cosmological events beyond my scope and scale exist within. It made me think of the movie Melancholia - of the ending. Such momentous, world-affecting phenomena are real, in the present. <reinin>It could happen to me.</reinin> It makes me think of the nukes dropping; how I'll be present in the moment it happens, when I'm reduced to atoms, and then further. I truly believe I'll be Kirsten Dunst's sister in the end: frantic, frenzied, howling, running. Losing all composure in the loss of all I am.</p>
                    <p>I wish my prose was better. I oft reread things I've written, though it pains me so, and I find my writing quite dry and repetitive. I've no access to blog035 or blog036 on this offline laptop, but I remember being disappointed in myself at the lack of gravitas I was able to apply to my own emotions. Whenever I reread the NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... blog post, I'm reminded of this too. I don't feel my words are enough to properly express myself, my emotions, in a unique, applicable sense. I also feel I purposely underremark things I love, in order to integrate their percieved faults into my tastes. But that's not representative of how I engage with art. I try to love things truly.</p>
                    <p>Being around my brother, sister, and nephew so much has also reminded me of the person I am around them. Of a person I do not like. I transform into all the forms of myself that I've built to respond to them. I feel weak, I feel small, I feel stuck-up, I feel unhappy, I feel underdeveloped. I turn into a version of myself that they expect to see, that I am not. And it's very hard to be around my nephew, as he's a ball of fire. He ignites everything around him, full of energy with no attention span or will to relent. He lacks a fundamental delicacy. And around these people, I myself cannot be delicate, nor can I be strong. I must simply be the shapeless form of expectation.</p>
                    <p>My brother's currently listening to a history podcast that's comparing Martin Luther to Jordan Peterson. We're in deep traffic, with many hours to go until Stillwater. I'll come into myself, and bloom into my own, once I'm in my room. Because I need delicacy, and strength, and to be alone.</p>
                    <p>Pre-publication addendum: I don't want to be alone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyIz8Y-j960">I want to make memories with people I dearly love.</a> I want to be free of here, now. I want to be held expeditiously.</p>
