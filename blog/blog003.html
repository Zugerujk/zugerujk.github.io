                    <p>If you know me, you know I take excursions to Minnesota. They're a pastime in my life; my entire extended family lives up there, so I've been taking these trips as long as I can remember. As for this particular occasion, my mom was planning to go up to Minnesota over the weekend to see one of her friends, so I tagged along to see my grandma. But, uh, yeah. Minnesota Roadtrip 2023, from Mediumtown Oklahoma to Mediumtown Minnesota! It's recap time.</p>
                    <p>My mom and I left our house at around 4pm (yikes!), and I drove for the first 3 hours. THEN, we switched, and she drove for about 3 hours. Then I took over for 2 more hours, and then she drove the final 2 hours. We arrived at my aunt's house at 2am, all in one piece. I should mention, I also saw my aunt while up there, but she's not exactly a rare sight. I still do appreciate her a lot, though ðŸ˜Œ.</p>

                    <p>The first full day there was Friday, the 15th of July. And I did absolutely nothing! I slept in until 3, got some Burger King for dinner (an Impossible Whopper with no tomato or pickle ðŸ˜‹), played some Splatoon 3 (Team Mint Chip in the Splatfest ðŸ«¡), lost my phone (we spent 20 minutes searching, it was on the bathroom windowsill), and then went to bed. Great day, what else can I say. The REAL day was up next, though, and I had to be up early.</p>
                    <p>Saturday, the 16th. The day where it happens. I wake up at 7am, shower, get my finest attire on (a Magdalena Bay long-sleeved shirt), and I'm off to the SPAM Museum. Well, actually, I had to fill the car's front left tire with gas, but THEN I was off to see the SPAM Museum. I'd visited before â€” two years prior, with Koromaru in tow â€” and felt it would be fun to return. Before that, though, I visited "The Coffee House", a cafe across the street. I'd had an iced mocha from them, two years ago, that changed my world. It SPAWNED my iced mocha addiction. So, of course, I had to go back for a second helping.</p>

                    <p>The meal was good, though I think my mind had heightened the iced mocha's reputation beyond any achievable level. Anyways, THEN I then went to the SPAM Museum. As a vegetarian, I sadly could not sample the edible merchandise, but I ended up picking up a new hat and long-sleeved shirt from the gift shop. I also perused the museum itself, and took some photos with Koro-chan.</p>

                    <p>I then drove 2.5 hours to my grandma's assisted living facility, passing a quarry. I greeted her at the door, and she brought me up to her room. She gave me some chilled almond bread and cookies, which were absolutely delicious. She's been getting into chilling cookies, 'cuz she thinks it draws out the flavor. And lowkey? She's kinda right.</p>
                    <p>We talked about a bunch of things - family history, current life happenings, movies we've seen. I showed her a bunch of my gunpla through photos on my phone, and she really really enjoyed them. She then showed me the quilt fabric she was working with, and a book of quilt fabrics. It was really sweet! We then went to the movie theatre literally a minute walk from her apartment. We'd talked the night before, and planned to watch Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. My dad tagged along, and uh. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/zugerujk/film/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny/">It was really enjoyable!</a></p>
                    <p>After that, we went to a coffee shop across the movie theatre. It's right next to a bar she loves to go to on Tuesdays. Apparently everything she needs is within walking distance, which is great! Anyways, I got an iced mocha (twice in one day) and a stuffed pretzel, and my grandma, my dad, and I talked about the movie and other movies we've seen. I talked about MILF Manor being fascinatingly terrible, and recommended some movies to grandma, and she recommended some movies to me. Which I plan on watching ðŸ«¡.</p>
                    <p>I then spent some time with just my dad, and it turns out he's an Amazon review scammer? He gets free products, writes fake reviews, and then flips them on eBay. It's so fucking lame. Anyways, I don't want to be negative, so I'm just gonna skip the hour we spent together. Had a MISERABLE 2.5 hour drive back, though. My lower abdomen hurt extremely badly from driving so much, so uh. Went straight to bed the moment I got back to my aunt's.</p>
                    <p>And Sunday? God. My mom drove the whole way home. I was in PAIN, it was BAD. Ow. I kinda miserably slept most the drive home. Nothing much happened. The trip overall was pretty great, though! Seeing my grandma was a wonderful, amazing time, and I'm blessed to have the opportunity. She's amazing to be around, and I love her so much. Shame she's connected to my dad. Here's a miscellaneous photo I accidentally took of me and Koromaru. Ignore my nose.</p>
