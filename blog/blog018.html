                    <p>I've been thinking a lot about the way I talk recently. I know, when I'm in a depressive episode, I take on a lower affect in the way I talk. However, more presently for me the past few days, I've been thinking about the very minor ways I change the way I talk around groups of people.</p>
                    <p>I visited Houston from the 17th to the 20th, to see M@, Kip, Frog, and Robbie in person and hang out. And it went really well! I love being around them, and I loved my time there. On the way back, though, M@'s dad drove me to the airport, and I. Idk. I spoke very normally, I guess. It's a weird thing to be self-conscious of, but I have a very "gay" voice. I've been directly profiled as gay thrice now because of the speaking tone and manner I naturally assume, and it's always a shock to hear just HOW gay I sound when I'm not in a depressive episode. I've kinda internalized the "depressive episode" voice as my internal voice, as I usually talk to myself when I'm, well, depressed. Sometimes I speak what I'm typing whenever I write these, and so that assumes the lower tone.</p>
                    <p>But, yeah. I felt different, when speaking to M@'s dad. He's a cool guy, I think? We had a pretty good talk, and he's a nice guy other than the time he misgendered someone, though I hope that was a mistake rather than intentional. Anyways, yeah, because of that I put on a more normal affect, and didn't really talk much about my existence other than my mental health (when he asked how college was going).</p>
                    <p>Anyways, I've been really into Lego Universe lately. I joined a private server called Lego Universe Reborn, which is ran by one guy, and it's kind of a blast to re-experience the game after a decade. I've had great times with people there! Shoutouts egmo, Idefix, NeonChronoLotus, Gabri, and others. But, uh, I realize I type and talk extremely differently in non-RFCK-adjacent circles of the internet. I was noticing this too when doing stuff in the Yo-kai Watch community, but I talk so... formal? And off-kilter? I assume this bizarre dialect, until eventually I just ending up mirroring the standard dialect of the community.</p>
                    <p>I say "standard dialect" because that's exactly what's happened with Lego Universe. There's a pretty strict chat filter - a holdover from the actual LEGO Universe's kid-friendly days - and so simple things like "heck", "booyah", and most everything I say, really, are banned. And so everyone in-game talks like a 2010s-era gamer, and that then extends to the community discord. And, so... I've just also adopted that, when I'm around these people? It's weird. It's a weird way to naturally talk, but it's what comes naturally when I'm playing Lego Universe.</p>
                    <p>Language is weird. I think I'm pro-extremely-bizarre-and-strict chat filter, purely because it makes the act of dialect construction interesting. I gotta say things like "fare thee well" because "seeya" is banned (and "see you" is too clunky). It's pretty, uh, idk. It's something.</p>
