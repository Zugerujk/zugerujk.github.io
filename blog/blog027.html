                    <p>I don't know how to cope with the fact that the human internet is gone. Even spambots had to be written by a person, just a few years ago. Every day I go online, I'm flooded with news of AI. It's clogged Google image search. Just today, OpenAI unveiled "Sora", which seems to be the death of widespread inherently-factual videography. Of human videography. Face filters had to be designed by artists. You'd have to manually touch up a photo. Fake images would have to be photoshopped by people.</p>
                    <p>I've tried to stay hopeful. But I can't even express how sad. How horrifying. How disgusting it all is. For millennia, humans made art. Hell, animals made art. And for a few good years, and many bad years, a lot of this was all accessible from a terminal at your house. My entire life, I've had access to the human internet. To know all the art, all the efforts of humanity I'm seeing, are true. Were made, in effort, by some human being, even if they hated it.</p>
                    <p>It's almost 5am. I've been pretty doomerish all day. Idk if the field I wanna go into - coding - is something that I'll feel comfortable doing in the future. Idk what the field will look like in 3 years. 10 years. I'm. I'm really scared. I'm wholly uninterested in what computers do without humanity. I only care for art with life, with soul, with mortality, with a true, guiding, real purpose. I don't know if the future of, well, art, is hopeful. It looks dismal. It looks terrifying, for someone who cares.</p>
                    <p>I need reevaluate my future. I'm so sad. I don't like the future. I don't like the guiding force of vampiric capital. I feel like coding is art. I put my heart, my soul, my being into what I write. But it will never be enough. This will all never be enough.</p>
