                    <h2>The Gundam Base Mobile USA Tour Tulsa Review</h2>

                    <p>Mouthful of a title, eh? Just got back from visiting The Gundam Base Mobile USA Tour's stop in Tulsa, OK, which, by all accounts, was a very impromptu and last-minute addition to the lineup. It was announced approximately 2 weeks ago, and... it shows. Anyways, first off, the good!</p>
                    <p>First, the staff were really great! They were great to strike up conversation with, and apparently they all really loved my SPAM hat (one loudly asked where I got it, another said later they all loved it). There's nothing bad I can say about them.</p>
                    <p>Okay! Now the neutral! The location, at Hobbytown USA in Tulsa, OK, is kinda a bizarre location, all things considered. I'm HAPPY it's there, because I live approximately 80 minutes away, but, uh, still. Second, the free stuff! There was a green screen photo opportunity, which wasn't good or bad, and kinda just <i>there</i>. There was also a gaming area and a hobby area, but nobody was at them, because of the weather.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the negative! First, the weather. They scheduled this outside, in late December, in Oklahoma. It was 40F! Very cold! Terrible idea! Schedule it for Fall or late Spring instead, Bandai. Second, the stock! Most of the stock was just normal retail stuff, which Hobbytown USA in Tulsa already readily had. Their Gundam Base exclusives were the Real Type Gundam Mk II, the Real Type Zaku II, a Clear HG Zaku II, a Clear MG Kyrios, and an MG Unicorn Perfectibility (which sold out before I got to the truck). It was... extremely small, for a Gundam Base Exclusive thing, as well as very lackluster and weird.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I had a really good time! Though I'm also generally confused with the "point" of the whole event, as it was... weirdly empty and lackluster. It also had a bunch of "gundam outreach" stuff, so-to-say, rather than actual dedicated things for people who are coming to this event. Anyways, shoutouts to my Clear Kyrios and Real Type Mk II. I own them and they are mine üòÅ</p>
