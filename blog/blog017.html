                    <h2>Disco Elysium, The Voyeurs, and endings</h2>
                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I finished Disco Elysium about 55 hours and 14 minutes ago (as of 1:16 PM). It's illuminated my mind in uncountable ways. <b>Heavy spoilers for Disco Elysium in this blog post. If you have not played the game, do not read this one. I've never been more serious about a spoiler warning in my life. Close this tab if you've not played it, even if you have no interest in it right now. Because some day, you might. And I don't want to be the person who's spoiled it for you.</b></p>
                    <p>I played throughout most of Disco Elysium in a form that came to uncomfortably reflect my real-life self; I maxed out Empathy, ended up denying any strict opportunity to "choose sides", motioned towards communist ideals, hurt people, failed in a lot of ways. I felt a lot like Harrier DuBois. Anyways, by the end of Day 4, I had seriously hurt Tommy Le Homme's feelings, Ruby killed herself, and I returned to town and got in a gunfight. Despite having a weapon, I jumped into the middle of it to try and lower tensions, did every skill check possible that didn't involve shooting my gun, and at the end of that I had the option to either shoot the scab, or continue pleading. And I had a really good chance on that "shoot the scab" roll. I chose to "continue pleading", though, and the gunfight, uh, <i>got hot</i>. 4 of the labor unionists died, I dodged a bullet then got shot, and as I lay dying I warned Kim and he used my gun to shoot someone.</p>
                    <p>Woke up 2 days later ingame, Kim told me the sitch, and we were both like "we did terribly, but we can still try". I told Tommy Le Homme that Ruby killed herself and then left town. Ended up investigating the island, slept on a bed while Kim watched and had a dream where I chased down my ex/Delores Dei, and then went to the final encounter.</p>
                    <p>The Deserter convo was rough. I only had so many options for what to say, because of my previous actions. M@ @'d me, and I joined a VC with just him and I while his spine corrected itself. I kinda talked about what the game had meant to me, while the Deserter talked about capital. And. Yeah.</p>
                    <p>Then the Insulindian Phasmid showed up. Which. I can't really express what this moment means to me, truly. It's something unknowable to even myself, but. It means so much. It cuts through the tension like a knife, and is just a miraculous, beautiful, mysterious, impossible, wonderful thing. The thing I investigated, like, 3 days ago, as a joke. I talked with it, and touched it, and Kim took a photo of us. It's the most magical moment I've had in a long time. It. It was something.</p>
                    <p>The ending was nice, too. But the Insulindian Phasmid. And the talk on capital. And everything about the game, from my Day 4 to the end.</p>
                    <p>I should clarify, I played Day 2 to the End all in 1 day. I was up for 27 hours. It was. It was worth it.</p>
                    <p>To quote myself, at 7:30 AM that morning, "But right now, I feel awoken. \ I feel uncrusted. \ I feel as if a fount has erupted from the earth, and though it may trickle in time, for now it is alive \ And to think on it too much would be a disservice to letting it flow \ I feel a physiomental shift in my upper torso and mind is required to start to feel exhaustion \ So this, in how it is presently, is very much temporary. \ But that’s okay. \ I felt it. It was real."</p>
                    <p>I had a "sort of" Major Friendship Breakup earlier that day, very suddenly and painfully. It was kinda unhealthy in the first place, so I'm probably better off without the unhealthy parts, but I was still mourning it greatly. And Disco Elysium, fuck, it really helped me work through all of that. And to know that I could still feel wonder, and life, and discovery, and beauty, even in the worst and hardest and most tense times.</p>

                    <p>To totally change gears, I've been lowkey obsessed with this movie called The Voyeurs. It's a Movie - it's paced well but too long, it's unbelievably stupid but also entirely self-fulfilling, it's. It's so many things. It's the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and it fascinates me. I watched it after seeing Jane Mulcahy's video that mentioned it, and I've now seen it twice. I showed 2 friends, for the rewatch. It was. Damn.</p>
                    <p>Following, after seeing the director's own letterboxd review of the movie, I emailed the director "Dear Monsieur Mohan, I. Wow. The Voyeurs is truly something. I watched it on recommendation from Jane Mulcahy, who really made it sound like truly something. And the film SHOCKED me. I had to show friends. And I just finished showing some friends. I'm so excited for whatever you work on next, monsieur Mohan. *image of shocked blue emoji* Go off"</p>
                    <p>Note, the film takes place in Montreal, so that's why I called him Monsieur. It's part of the bit. Anyways, he sent this back</p>

                    <p>Life is good. Life is really, really great. His email made me cry positively with how shockingly funny and nice he was, and also that he *investigated the letterboxd of his movie*. KING shit. Holy shit. I'll be seated day one for Immaculate.</p>
