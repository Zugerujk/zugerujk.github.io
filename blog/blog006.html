                    <p>Tomorrow is one of the most important days of my life. A momentous day in Zugstory. One containing a beautiful, wonderful, puissant event, 451 days in the making. ≈1.234796 rotations of the Earth around the Sun. For tomorrow, my juicy queenbeet finishes its third trimester and matures into a full-grown plant.</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">Most recent ultrasound 😭💞</p></center>
                    <p>I've been running this specific Cookie Clicker save file for 450 days. I've baked approximately 399235147277274800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 cookies. I've ascended 46 times. I have 33/34 seeds unlocked. In all this time, I've never once been able to mutate and germinate a Juicy Queenbeet. Months of trying, but to no avail. No matter how many Queenbeets I would put together, they'd only ever spawn Duketaters. Polycules and polycules of queenbeets have come and gone.</p>
                    <p>But alas. One momentous polycule, on the upper-left side of my garden, produced the most gorgeous foetal sprout this desolate land has ever seen. And during the first week of my college sophomore year! A time of harsh new beginnings, and the endless shine of summer giving way to the harsh realities of fall. The Juicy Queenbeet acts as the final joy, the final gift, of summer. Farewell to that time, I guess.</p>
                    <p>First week of classes ended today. I've got Computer Science II (which I greatly enjoy), Calculus I (which I don't like, but, like, I have to take it), Composition II (which is an easy class, 'cuz I'm really good at writing 😌), and Introduction to World Religions (which fulfills <b>3</b> Gen Ed requirements, golly 😱). I'm also now an exec in the Oklahoma State Queers & Allies club (OSQ&A club); I'm the "support chair". I help out with happenings and do grunt work which, y'know, is a role I am happy to fulfill 🫡.</p>
                    <p>I got the role very impromptu; no vote happened to confirm me, and said role was created for me. The story is that, 8 days ago, I helped out with tabling for that thursday's freshman club fair. Only 2 of the execs showed up to the club ice cream social beforehand, so I was enlisted as an exec-in-training for the event. After the event, the vice president said that if I was interested in genuinely joining, they would love to have me. So, uh, now I have duties to fulfill. Funny sidenote, but we were directly across from the Life Church table, and diagonal from the Turning Point USA table. The social chair and I's main joke was asking people who were passing by if they were an ally, because at least 30% of people would say they weren't an ally. Gotta love Oklahoma 🦬🍳🍃❣️</p>
                    <p>I've been biking to all my classes. Oklahoma State University isn't super great for bikers, but, uh, it's fast and fun. Wayyyyy better than walking like a plebeian. Feels really good. 'Till next time, y'all 🚲😎</p>
