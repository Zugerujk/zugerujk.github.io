                    <p>The website's at a full release, now. Um, it's exactly how I initially envisioned it. But I, uh, am feeling depressed, about that? Idk. I feel like I've lost motivation, lost some goal within me. I'm real proud of this, and I'm glad I did it, but, I mean. I did it. But I liked the doing it, more than it being done. I can still add general polish, and new features, and clean things up, make it run better, but. There's no long-term goal I have envisioned, anymore, other than utilizing this site and, well, maintenance. Whenever I finish a big project, I get real depressed, 'cuz, I mean. I like working. I really like working on things. I'm always surprised by the emptiness I feel after finishing a project, but. Y'know? I just expect the jubilation to last longer than it really does.</p>
                    <p>I remember when I finished the Ranking All Jibanyans video, I went for a swim. It was summer 2020, a bad time, and I had spent weeks pulling all-nighters editing that thing. I would go to bed at 8am and wake up around 5pm. But after I finished it, I went for a noon swim. I felt really empty, in that pool. I felt unhappy about finishing the project.</p>
                    <p>I remember Slimefest 9 went really well - much better than I ever expected, after organizing the whole thing, and having witnessed firsthand the mess that was Slimefest 8 - and. I entered an extreme depression afterwards, for months. It just, I mean, it sent me into a depressive episode. I was on high-alert for days, planning, scheduling, then streaming the whole thing, and. It fucked me up! I couldn't physically handle the "it being done"-ness of it. I felt empty, I felt glad it was over, I felt, like. Y'know. "Nothing worse can happen now". That's honestly the primary feeling I got.</p>
                    <p>I've been accepted into a community college, and, uh. I need to look for an apartment in the city, and get classes scheduled, and the whole shebang. I hope it works out. I wanna try my hardest. I like working on stuff! I just. Fuck. Life's rough. I don't have a good thesis statement, just that finishing things is really depressing. I know I'll feel better in a few days' time, but. Meh.</p>
