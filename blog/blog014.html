                    <p>First, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/business/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-death/index.html">RIP Sarah Katz</a>. This lemonade is unbelievably filled with caffeine, inaccurately marketed, and Panera is totally at fault. I hope her family gets all the money they can out of Panera, at the very least.</p>
                    <p>Second, Panera Bread is a special store to me. In my college's OSQ&A club, we regularly go to Panera Bread for "gay dinner" after exec meetings. And I, jokingly, call it the "house of God". "What happens at Panera Bread stays at Panera Bread", one might even say. It's a sacred ground where we complain about our life and how worried we are for future club events. It's, like, home. I love their horrific bagged Mac and Cheese.</p>

                    <p>I've been in a depressive episode, and have had an especially depressive day today. Slept for 16 hours the night before. I don't have groceries, so why not, I went to Panera. I gotta EXPLAIN why I go to Panera Bread because it's <i>soooo embarrassing</i> I actually like their food. Anyways, I read tweets about the Charged Lemonade, and oh my god. I had to try it.</p>
                    <p>I didn't pay for the drink, don't worry. I got water like normal, and when I cleaned up my plate at the end, I drank all the water and then got a lil' bit of the charged lemonade. I ominously drank it near the window of the Panera Bread, looking out into the dreary rainy weather (like Death Stranding!). And. Y'know. It tasted like uncomfortably sour strawberry lemonade. It had a really ugly artificial sour candy strawberry aftertaste. I didn't like it. It was quite bad.</p>

                    <p>In terms of food, I tried a Feastables when I was hanging out with my friends Fadi and Dylan 2 nights ago (around 3am, this Tuesday). I tried a Feastables Mr. Beast bar Crunch that night with them, which I picked up at the new 7/11 in town they love going to. It tasted like a worse Crunch bar. Do not recommend. Sorry Jimmy.</p>

                    <p>ADDENDUM FROM 10/26/2023 5:08:36 PM CST! - I got a horrific headache after writing this blog post. One of the worst I've had in recent memory! It was almost like a chemotherapy headache; one so bad it makes you nauseous. I'm like 60% sure it was due to the criminal amount of caffeine in the killer lemonade. So, uh, buyer beware (even though I didn't buy)!</p>
