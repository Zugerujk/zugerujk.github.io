                    <p>Did some errands today. Felt real good.</p>
                    <p>I woke up and went to my Calculus class. Chilled through it, and at the end (at 11:20), biked over to my mom's car. Locked my bike up, grabbed the keys from her, and began ERRANDING. Well, first I swung by Aspen Coffee (a local coffee chain, I'm pretty sure) and picked up and Iced Mocha üòã. Afterwards, I drove to Alan's Pharmacy and picked up my Caplyta refill. Was quite chill. According the paper on their window it's time to get an updated Covid booster. I'll try to get that scheduled for this weekend.</p>
                    <p>After getting my meds, I took a jaunt to the Stillwater Public Library and returned This Is How You Lose the Time War. It was a pretty okay book that I got about halfway through, but ultimately it didn't feel like "my thing". After returning that book I checked out Annihilation, by Jeff VanderMeer. It's a first print copy from 2014, so it's a little beat up. Adds personality (:</p>

                    <p>After the library excursion, I went to my local Walmart Supercenter and picked up some groceries. Of note, I grabbed some wall-safe adhesive things so I can hang up my posters (which I've now done). They had these horrifying Pistol Pete standees everywhere. Dunno who approved those, but it was a mistake. I also noticed that they didn't stop and search through my groceries when exiting the store this time; I forgot to bring my reusable bags, so I had to use Walmart's plastic bags. I never realized that that's not, like, a thing they usually do when you buy a bunch of groceries. So, uh, if you wanna steal from Walmart, don't use reusable bags, I guess.</p>

                    <p>After Walmart, I drove to my mom's house and picked up a package from neongrizzly.com. 'Twas some Internet Comment Etiquette merch. To be specific, it was some Halloween Soyboy magnets, a CEASE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS Pastel Rainbow T-shirt, and a CEASE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS holographic sticker. Some nice stuff. My fridge currently looks hella swag with all the halloween soyboys on it. Anyways, after picking up that package, I drove back to my apartment, put away my groceries, and then went to my 1:30 Composition II class.</p>
                    <p>Doing those errands was really personally fulfilling. It just feels so good to do errands, y'know? Erranding out. Makes me feel productive.</p>
