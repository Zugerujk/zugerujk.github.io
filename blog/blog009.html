                    <p>Foreword, sorry if this blog post is maybe written weirdly, my right hand is currently in jail (extreme wrist pain, so I'm wearing a wrist brace. Typing is a lil slow, lmao). But I've played a lot of <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> <img src="blog-media/008logo4.png" alt="4" height="12px" width="auto">! I'm currently on Day 16, so, uh, I've spent a lot of time in the game. I'm fully through the first 2 areas, and have discovered red, ice, yellow, blue, and rock <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> (plus glow <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto">🥺)! I was extremely shocked when blue <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> were the 4th guys I discovered, and in the first area no less! I'm extremely happy to see my rock guys back, too. I love them dearly.</p>
                    <p>In terms of surprises, zamn. When I first saw an Iridescent Flint Beetle I pogged at my screen and went "iridescent flint beetle :y" out loud. And when I did my first night mission, hearing the dawn version of the results screen theme gave me chills. <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> <img src="blog-media/008logo4.png" alt="4" height="12px" width="auto"> really is a game I've been waiting a decade for, and every morsel of it I'm unbelievably happy to gobble up. It's so creative! It's glorious! It's everything I've ever imagined out of <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> <img src="blog-media/008logo4.png" alt="4" height="12px" width="auto">, and so much more.</p>

                    <p>In terms of life? It's also going pretty <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> swimmingly. Yesterday I talked with people in RFCK about the bestie possibly getting a job in Minecraft Bedrock? Which is fucking amazing, I believe in them so much. Later that Friday night, I hung out with Kip in VC, and then after that, me and Mischief started watching Children of Men. Gale, Solar Moth, and Goldspin joined in, and holy shit. After Children of Men we watched Fred 2: Night of the Living Fred (at 3.6x speed), and then after that perused the movie reviewer Movieguide to try and find their most scandalous review. <a href="https://www.movieguide.org/reviews/movies/the-shape-of-water.html">We found out it was The Shape of Water.</a> MAX language, MAX violence, MAX sex, MAX nudity, -4 content warning (for intentional blasphemy), and an entertainment quality of 4 stars (the max possible). Which, having seen the movie, is so true. It's a very good movie.</p>
                    <p>In blog format, explaining how fucking hilarious it was to find the The Shape of Water review kinda falls flat. But that's, y'know, okay. My blog posts exist as I write them, in my frame of mind and view. <b>I</b> remember it as funny, so, y'know. (:</p>
                    <p>Now that I live in the middle of town in Stillwater, and it's Game Day™️, I've heard so many police sirens and ambulances. I live about a block from the fire station, so this is on top of all the fire trucks I hear daily. I don't mind - it's kinda cool background noise - but, idk. How unique. My living situation has me experience these sounds now. I played some of the Splatoon 3 Big Run today, with my wrist brace on. Splatoon is quite difficult in wrist jail, but damn, I'm good at Salmon Run. And y'know? It's not so bad having terrible tendons. Things could be worse. And I still can talk with those I love, and hang out with people who bring me genuine joy.</p>
                    <p>Shoutouts to all my friends. And <img src="blog-media/008logopikmin.png" alt="Pikmin" height="12px" width="auto"> <img src="blog-media/008logo4.png" alt="4" height="12px" width="auto">, of course. And my laundry, which according to my phone timer, JUST got done drying.</p>
