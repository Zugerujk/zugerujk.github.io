                    <div class="news_feed_entry_divider"></div>
                    <p>I just spent ONE HOUR watching MR BEAST VIDEOS. Find out what happened NEXT</p>
                    <p>Uh, idk. I've been pretty beastable lately, and I tried a Feastable bar at my friend Kip's house (their sister had it), and eh, wasn't that good. But I've felt the call of Jimmy, and his content. Jimmy Beast has made so much Youtube content. He's like GOD. But in BEAST format. So, uh, I remember him counting to, like, a million 4 years ago. Weird to see him actually, like, the biggest guy of Youtube. But that's just how the beast mode goes.</p>
                    <p>I watched: Lamborghini Vs Shredder, I Paid A Real Assassin To Try To Kill Me, I Hunted 100 People!, $1 vs $500,000 Plane Ticket!, I Didn't Eat Food For 30 Days (stopped watching halfway through because it felt very eating disorder-y ðŸ˜”), $10,000 Every Day You Survive Prison, World's Most Dangerous Escape Room, and I Built Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory!.</p>
                    <p>Lotta Beast content. And I gotta say. Not a fan. Feels like a baby sensory video, except it costs hundreds of thousands and also promotes NFT scams, or Feastables, or Intuit Turbotax, or Ziprecruiter. My mind smoothed over watching Jimmy's content. But idk. I watched this with Kip, and they just told me to clarify, this was NOT their idea.</p>
                    <p>Jimmy? I'm gonna talk to you straight-on. I think you're a cool dude. I think Mr Beast is a interesting concept. I feel like it's maybe a little wasteful? And maybe promotes scams and schemes to children a bit too much. But it's entertaining, I guess. Have you watched Suspiria (2018)? You should trap 40 women in a real room and have a last person standing to rip open their chest. Also you should watch Suspiria.</p>
                    <p>Good night Jimmy. Stay Beastable ðŸ«¡</p>
