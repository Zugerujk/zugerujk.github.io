                    <p>Amongus Nathan the Nord has been going through some shit, y'all.</p>
                    <p>Morrowind is like nothing else. It's genuinely one of the greatest games I've ever played. Having another adventure through Vvardenfell has really solidified this for me - it's the best thing Bethesda has ever done, to such a blindingly high degree. I started replaying Morrowind because I was replaying New Vegas, and replaying New Vegas just purely made me wanna replay Morrowind. Obsidian did the best fallout, but Morrowind is the best Bethesda-style RPG there is. The world and story are so intricately-crafted, and it's somewhat small but fills its space so massively and deliberately that it feels expansive.</p>
                    <p>Amongus Nathan went on to join House Redoran ('cuz my first playthrough was house Telvanni ðŸ˜¬ oops!), did a bunch of the Tribunal Cult and Morag Tong stuff (which I never did my first playthrough), explored the entirety of Sheogorad (a region I almost entirely skipped in my first playthrough), did all of the Mages Guild and Fighters Guild quests (and most of the Thieves Guild quests), and got through the main story up to being named Urshilaku Nerevarine and Hlaalu Hortator. After that, Amongus Nathan the Nord did a hop, skip, and a jump over to Mournhold and, uh, did all Tribunal stuff! And boy, I have some thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Tribunal is definitely not as fun on a second playthrough. The wonder of going to Mournhold, of seeing new stuff and guys, does NOT stick around. And the main quest of Mournhold is effectively a straight line, so replaying it is a lot of "going from A to B" (which you've already done). All the sidequests are cool the first time around, but don't have... lasting power, I should say? Idk. And once you finish the main story, and come back to Mournhold, it's just... static. It's empty, it's dead, its soul has left its body. I feel this way about most RPGs that don't have a solid ending â€” you hit a point where all characters and quests have exhausted themselves, and you're left with an unchanging, static world. This obviously isn't a Bethesda problem â€” both NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... and Death Stranding have this exact problem, where you reach the end of the game, and then nothing changes ever forever. Death Stranding has a wide variety of dynamic characters who will email you throughout the game and as you do their miscellaneous deliveries... until a certain point, where it Stops. And then the world is silent, besides from NPC porters and other players. The only characters you see in Death Stranding in-person outside of cutscenes are NPC porters. And so in Mournhold, you beat the main quest, and then the world just freezes in place. It becomes devoid of life.</p>
                    <p>It's very uncomfortable, isn't it?</p>
                    <p>Now that Amongus Nathan the Nord is back from Mournhold, I'm finishing up some sidequest chains and, well, continuing the main quest. And it's kinda sad to know that the world will freeze in place once I'm done with the main quest. I know that that's inevitable, with any RPG that does not End, but. It's a lil' sad. At least there's still Solstheim as a real neat epilogue.</p>

                    <center><p class="caption">The stunning beauty of this fucking video game. It's really dark and I haven't changed the gamma in-game, so, uh. On my PC it looks really moody and good, on my laptop it's unreadable black sludge. ðŸ˜Ž</p></center>
                    <p>Thought about I Saw the TV Glow a shitton over the past 1.5 weeks. Kinography, y'all. Kinography! I've also seen, notably, April Story and Alien this past week. Movies are so fucking good.</p>
                    <p>I've been walking on my aunt's LiveStrong treadmill, in the basement I live in, and it's been quite rough! I do it while reading The Castle, because The Castle is such an insane slog I cannot help myself from putting it down. If I read it while walking at a pace slightly faster than I am comfortable, I'll put it down, but that'll cause my brain to have to focus on walking, which is worse than reading, so I'll pick the book back up. It feels like torture, but surprisingly works quite well. Except, of course, for my foot injury.</p>
                    <p>I fucked up my left foot about 1.5 years ago. My first childhood crush of 4 years and I began "going out" (for about 3 weeks, until we called it quits), and the first time I went over to their place to hang out, I, uh. I sprained my left foot, when getting off of their bed to grab a Baja Blast. EXTREMELY badly. I was limping everywhere for months. I thought it was in my past, but when I walk on a treadmill nowadays, it causes the sprain to act up again. And I understand that some injuries are permanent, and I have a calcium deposit on my foot, so that's not going away. And I never was the biggest fan of walking â€” I've always biked when possible â€” but man. The body keeps the fuckin' score. It's rough to be reminded of that when I do something as basic as, well, walking.</p>
                    <p>I need to finish The Castle expeditiously. It's a complete slog of a book I hate reading, but it's <i>so good</i>. It's so good! It's really fucked up, y'all. So fucked up.</p>
